# FPS-Demo

A demo of a FPS created with Unreal Engine 4.

A ~12 minute video of gameplay can be seen here (link)

The game can be downloaded for Windows here (link)

What to expect from this game:
- 4 months worth of a game from working with Unreal Engine 4
- 100% free assets
- All art assets not created by me (excluding a few basic things like crosshairs and decals)
- Everything implemented by me from reading/watching tutorials - nothing is just copied and pasted (There is one exception here and that is the material used for creating a yellow highlight around meshes; I have borrowed this without bothering to figure out how it works)
- Saving and loading to not work
